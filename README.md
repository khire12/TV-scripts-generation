# TV-scripts-generation
Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree project

This project is a part of coursework. The project deals with text generation from a dataset. The dataset is a tv show script from Seinfeld. The text data file is provided by Udacity. <br>
Use of Long-short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) to implement the project. 

**Steps**:
1. Preprocessing
2. Model construction 
3. Model training
4. Script generation

**Following are the hyperparameters for the LSTM network**:
1. number of epochs = 10
2. learning rate = 0.001 
3. output size = total number of words
4. embedding_dim = 200
5. hidden_dim = 250
6. n_layers = 2
<br>

**Output** <br>
**Traininig loss**: 3.211519
